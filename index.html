                        Personally, Batman has always seemed the most realistic
                        superhero – if you can use that phrase. It almost seems
                        like he is simply a bored man with way too much money!

                        Whether you call him The Dark Knight or The Caped
                        Crusader, this superhero has captured the hearts and
                        minds of people across the globe for generations.

                        Madison, Catwoman, Vicki Vale, and of course Batwoman.

                        The role of Batman in the 1989 Batman blockbuster was
                        actually offered to various other stars prior to Michael
                        Keaton, including Pierce Brosnan – who couldn’t play the
                        part due to his opinion of the hosiery-clad hero.

                        Keaton was actually supposed to lead, but Val Kilmer was
                        given the opportunity when Michael simply demanded too
                        much money.

                        The fearmongering city of Gotham actually landed its
                        name simply from the writer randomly choosing a
                        jeweller’s named <em>Gotham Jewellers</em> in a
                        telephone directory.

                        Frank Miller is generally credited with restoring Batman
                        to his old gritty self with “<em
                            >The Dark Knight Returns.</em
                        >” This was a four-issue series published in 1986, where
                        an aged Batman comes out of retirement, joined by a new
                        Robin, to clean up the streets of a Gotham run amok.

                        Over the years, Batman’s main rivals have been the

                        the Scarecrow, and the lesser known Mr. Freeze and

                        The superhero’s real name Bruce Wayne is actually a

                        a Scottish and American Revolutionary Hero respectively.

                        Kevin Conroy, the man who has played Batman the longest,

                        The infamous Catwoman costume from the 1992 film, which
                        initially seemed as if it was painted on, was actually a
                        vacuum sealed costume. The actor, Michelle Pfeiffer,
                        said she only had a small window to act before it
                        unsealed.

                        Bus ads containing Catwoman promoting the Batman Returns
                        blockbuster were actually stolen to such a degree, that
                        security teams were dispatched to ensure they stayed in
                        their correct locations.
